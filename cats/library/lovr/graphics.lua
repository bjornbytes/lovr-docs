---The graphics module renders graphics and performs computation using the GPU.
---
---Most of the graphics functions are on the `Pass` object.
---
---@class lovr.graphics
lovr.graphics = {}

---Compiles shader code to SPIR-V bytecode.  The bytecode can be passed to `lovr.graphics.newShader` to create shaders, which will be faster than creating it from GLSL. The bytecode is portable, so bytecode compiled on one platform will work on other platforms. This allows shaders to be precompiled in a build step.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The input can be GLSL or SPIR-V.  If it's SPIR-V, it will be returned unchanged as a Blob.
---
---If the shader fails to compile, an error will be thrown with the error message.
---
---@param stage ShaderStage The type of shader to compile.
---@param source string A string or filename with shader code.
---@return Blob bytecode A Blob containing compiled SPIR-V code.
function lovr.graphics.compileShader(stage, source) end

---Returns the global background color.  The textures in a render pass will be cleared to this color at the beginning of the pass if no other clear option is specified.  Additionally, the headset and window will be cleared to this color before rendering.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Setting the background color in `lovr.draw` will apply on the following frame, since the default pass is cleared before `lovr.draw` is called.
---
---Internally, this color is applied to the default pass objects when retrieving one of them using `lovr.headset.getPass` or `lovr.graphics.getWindowPass`.  Both are called automatically by the default `lovr.run` implementation.
---
---Using the background color to clear the display is expected to be more efficient than manually clearing after a render pass begins, especially on mobile GPUs.
---
---@return number r The red component of the background color.
---@return number g The green component of the background color.
---@return number b The blue component of the background color.
---@return number a The alpha component of the background color.
function lovr.graphics.getBackgroundColor() end

---Returns a temporary Buffer.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The format table can contain a list of `DataType`s or a list of tables to provide extra information about each field.  Each inner table has the following keys:
---
---- `type` is the `DataType` of the field and is required.
---- `name` is the name of the field, used to match table keys and vertex attribute names.
---- `offset` is the byte offset of the field.  Any fields with a `nil` offset will be placed next
---  to each other sequentially in memory, subject to any padding required by the Buffer's layout.
---  In practice this means that you probably want to provide an `offset` for either all of the
---  fields or none of them.
---- `length` is the array size of the field.
---
---As a shorthand, the name, type, and optionally the length of a field can be provided as a list instead of using keys.
---
---If no table or Blob is used to define the initial Buffer contents, its data will be undefined.
---
---#### Example:
---
---Examples of different buffer formats.

---```lua

---lovr.graphics.getBuffer('mat4', 2)

---#### Notes:
---
---The format table can contain a list of `DataType`s or a list of tables to provide extra information about each field.  Each inner table has the following keys:
---
---- `type` is the `DataType` of the field and is required.
---- `name` is the name of the field, used to match table keys and vertex attribute names.
---- `offset` is the byte offset of the field.  Any fields with a `nil` offset will be placed next
---  to each other sequentially in memory, subject to any padding required by the Buffer's layout.
---  In practice this means that you probably want to provide an `offset` for either all of the
---  fields or none of them.
---- `length` is the array size of the field.
---
---As a shorthand, the name, type, and optionally the length of a field can be provided as a list instead of using keys.
---
---If no table or Blob is used to define the initial Buffer contents, its data will be undefined.

---It is not currently possible to get the version of the driver, although this could be added.
---
---Regarding multiple GPUs: If OpenXR is enabled, the OpenXR runtime has control over which GPU is used, which ensures best compatibility with the VR headset.  Otherwise, the "first" GPU returned by the renderer will be used.  There is currently no other way to pick a GPU to use.

---#### Notes:
---
---Fun facts about render passes:
---
---- Textures must have been created with the `render` `TextureUsage`.
---- Textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and sample counts.
---- When rendering to textures with multiple layers, each draw will be broadcast to all layers.
---  Render passes have multiple "views" (cameras), and each layer uses a corresponding view,
---  allowing each layer to be rendered from a different viewpoint.  This enables fast stereo
---  rendering, but can also be used to efficiently render to cubemaps.  The `ViewIndex` variable
---  can also be used in shaders to set up any desired per-view behavior.
---- Mipmaps will automatically be generated for textures at the end of the render pass.
---- It's okay to have zero color textures, but in this case there must be a depth texture.
---- It's possible to render to a specific mipmap level of a Texture, or a subset of its layers, by
---  rendering to texture views, see `Texture:newView`.
---
---For `compute` passes, all of the commands in the pass act as though they run in parallel.  This means that writing to the same element of a buffer twice, or writing to it and reading from it again is not guaranteed to work properly on all GPUs.  If compute or transfers need to be sequenced, multiple passes should be used.  It is, however, completely fine to read and write to non-overlapping regions of the same buffer or texture.

---@param canvas {depth: {format: TextureFormat, texture: Texture}, samples: number} Render pass configuration.  Up to 4 textures can be provided in table keys 1 through 4. Ignored for non-render passes.
---@return Pass pass The new Pass.
function lovr.graphics.getPass(type, canvas) end

---Returns the window pass.  This is a builtin render `Pass` object that renders to the desktop window texture.  If the desktop window was not open when the graphics module was initialized, this function will return `nil`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---`lovr.conf` may be used to change the settings for the pass:  `t.graphics.antialias` enables antialiasing, and `t.graphics.stencil` enables the stencil buffer.
---
---This pass clears the window texture to the background color, which can be changed using `lovr.graphics.setBackgroundColor`.
---
---@return Pass pass The window pass, or `nil` if there is no window.
function lovr.graphics.getWindowPass() end

---Returns the type of operations the GPU supports for a texture format, if any.
---
---@param format TextureFormat The texture format to query.
---@param ...features TextureFeature Zero or more features to check.  If no features are given, this function will return whether the GPU supports *any* feature for this format.  Otherwise, this function will only return true if *all* of the input features are supported.
---@return boolean linear Whether the GPU supports these operations for textures with this format, when created with the `linear` flag set to `true`.
---@return boolean srgb Whether the GPU supports these operations for textures with this format, when created with the `linear` flag set to `false`.
function lovr.graphics.isFormatSupported(format, ...features) end

---Returns whether timing stats are enabled.  When enabled, `Pass:getStats` will return `submitTime` and `gpuTime` durations.  Timing is enabled by default when `t.graphics.debug` is set in `lovr.conf`.  Timing has a small amount of overhead, so it should only be enabled when needed.
---
---@return boolean enabled Whether timing is enabled.
function lovr.graphics.isTimingEnabled() end

---Creates a Buffer.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The format table can contain a list of `DataType`s or a list of tables to provide extra information about each field.  Each inner table has the following keys:
---
---- `type` is the `DataType` of the field and is required.
---- `name` is the name of the field, used to match table keys and vertex attribute names.
---- `offset` is the byte offset of the field.  Any fields with a `nil` offset will be placed next
---  to each other sequentially in memory, subject to any padding required by the Buffer's layout.
---  In practice this means that you probably want to provide an `offset` for either all of the
---  fields or none of them.
---- `length` is the array size of the field.
---
---As a shorthand, the name, type, and optionally the length of a field can be provided as a list instead of using keys.
---
---If no table or Blob is used to define the initial Buffer contents, its data will be undefined.

---@param blob Blob A Blob containing vertex data, formatted according to the vertex format.  The size of the Blob will be used to set the vertex count of the Mesh, and must be a multiple of the vertex size.
---@param storage? MeshStorage The storage mode of the Mesh.
---@return Mesh mesh The new Mesh.
function lovr.graphics.newMesh(format, blob, storage) end

---Creates a Mesh.  The capacity of the Mesh must be provided upfront, using either a vertex count or the vertex data itself.  A custom vertex format can be given to specify the set of attributes in each vertex, which get sent to the vertex shader.  If the format isn't given, the default vertex format will be used:
---
---    {
---      { 'VertexPosition', 'vec3' },
---      { 'VertexNormal', 'vec3' },
---      { 'VertexUV', 'vec2' }
---    }
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The Mesh will always use the `gpu` storage mode if it's created from a vertex buffer.
---
---#### Example:
---
---```lua
---function lovr.load()
---  mesh = lovr.graphics.newMesh({
---    { 'VertexPosition', 'vec3' },
---    { 'VertexColor', 'vec4' }
---  }, {
---    {   0,  .4, 0 , 1, 0, 0, 1 },
---    { -.5, -.4, 0 , 0, 1, 0, 1 },
---    {  .5, -.4, 0 , 0, 0, 1, 1 }
---  })
---end
---
---function lovr.draw(pass)
---  pass:draw(mesh, 0, 1.7, -1)
---end
---```
---
---@param buffer Buffer A Buffer containing vertex data.  Its length will be used as the vertex count, and its format will be used as the vertex format.
---@return Mesh mesh The new Mesh.
function lovr.graphics.newMesh(buffer) end

---Loads a 3D model from a file.  Currently, OBJ, glTF, and binary STL files are supported.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Currently, the following features are not supported by the model importer:
---
---- glTF: Only the default scene is loaded.
---- glTF: Currently, each skin in a Model can have up to 256 joints.
---- glTF: Meshes can't appear multiple times in the node hierarchy with different skins, they need
---  to use 1 skin consistently.
---- glTF: `KHR_texture_transform` is supported, but all textures in a material will use the same
---  transform.
---- STL: ASCII STL files are not supported.
---
---Diffuse and emissive textures will be loaded using sRGB encoding, all other textures will be loaded as linear.
---
---Loading a model file will fail if the asset references textures or other files using absolute paths.  Relative paths should be used instead, and will be relative to the model file within the virtual filesystem.

---Creates and returns a new Pass object.  The canvas (the set of textures the Pass renders to) can be specified when creating the Pass, or later using `Pass:setCanvas`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Fun facts about render passes:
---
---- Textures must have been created with the `render` `TextureUsage`.
---- Textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and sample counts.
---- When rendering to textures with multiple layers, each draw will be broadcast to all layers.
---  Render passes have multiple "views" (cameras), and each layer uses a corresponding view,
---  allowing each layer to be rendered from a different viewpoint.  This enables fast stereo
---  rendering, but can also be used to efficiently render to cubemaps.  The `ViewIndex` variable
---  can also be used in shaders to set up any desired per-view behavior.
---- Mipmaps will automatically be generated for textures at the end of the render pass.
---- It's okay to have zero color textures, but in this case there must be a depth texture.
---- It's possible to render to a specific mipmap level of a Texture, or a subset of its layers, by
---  rendering to texture views, see `Texture:newView`.

---
---#### Notes:
---
---If no `type` is provided in the options table, LÖVR will guess the `TextureType` of the Texture based on the number of layers:

---Submits work to the GPU.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The submitted `Pass` objects will run in the order specified.  Commands within a single Pass do not have any ordering guarantees.
---
---Submitting work to the GPU is not thread safe.  No other `lovr.graphics` or `Pass` functions may run at the same time as `lovr.graphics.submit`.
---
---Calling this function will invalidate any temporary buffers or passes that were created during the frame.

---Submitting work to the GPU is a relatively expensive operation.  It's a good idea to batch all `Pass` objects into 1 submission if possible, unless there's a good reason not to.  One such reason would be that the frame has so much work that some of it needs to be submitted early to prevent the GPU from running out of things to do.  Another would be for `Readback` objects.
---
---By default, this function is called with the default pass at the end of `lovr.draw` and `lovr.mirror`.
---
---It is valid to submit zero passes.  This will send an empty batch of work to the GPU.
---
---@param ... Pass The pass objects to submit.  Falsy values will be skipped.
---@return boolean true Always returns true, for convenience when returning from `lovr.draw`.
function lovr.graphics.submit(...) end

---Submits work to the GPU.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The submitted `Pass` objects will run in the order specified.  Commands within a single Pass do not have any ordering guarantees.
---
---Submitting work to the GPU is not thread safe.  No other `lovr.graphics` or `Pass` functions may run at the same time as `lovr.graphics.submit`.
---
---Calling this function will invalidate any temporary buffers or passes that were created during the frame.

---@return boolean true Always returns true, for convenience when returning from `lovr.draw`.
function lovr.graphics.submit(t) end

---Waits for all submitted GPU work to finish.  A normal application that is trying to render graphics at a high framerate should never use this function, since waiting like this prevents the CPU from doing other useful work.  Otherwise, reasons to use this function might be for debugging or to force a `Readback` to finish immediately.
---
function lovr.graphics.wait() end

---A Buffer is a block of memory on the GPU.  It's like a GPU version of a `Blob`.  Lua code can write data to the buffer which uploads to VRAM, and shaders read buffer data during rendering. Compute shaders can also write to buffers.
---
---The **size** of a Buffer is the number of bytes of VRAM it occupies.  It's set when the Buffer is created and can't be changed afterwards.
---
---Buffers can optionally have a **format**, which defines the type of data stored in the buffer. The format determines how Lua values are converted into binary.  Like the size, it can't change after the buffer is created.  `Shader:getBufferFormat` returns the format of a variable in a `Shader`.
---
---When a Buffer has a format, it also has a **length**, which is the number of items it holds, and a **stride**, which is the number of bytes between each item.
---
---`Buffer:setData` is used to upload data to the Buffer.  `Buffer:clear` can also be used to efficiently zero out a Buffer.
---
---`Buffer:getData` can be used to download data from the Buffer, but be aware that it stalls the GPU until the download is complete, which is very slow!  `Buffer:newReadback` will instead download the data in the background, which avoids costly stalls.
---
---Buffers are often used for mesh data.  Vertices stored in buffers can be drawn using `Pass:mesh`.  `Mesh` objects can also be used, which wrap Buffers along with some extra metadata.
---
---Buffers can be "bound" to a variable in a Shader using `Pass:send`.  That means that the next time the shader runs, the data from the Buffer will be used for the stuff in the variable.
---
---It's important to understand that data from a Buffer will only be used at the point when graphics commands are actually submitted.  This example records 2 draws, changing the buffer data between each one:
---
---    buffer:setData(data1)
---    pass:mesh(buffer)
---    buffer:setData(data2)
---    pass:mesh(buffer)
---    lovr.graphics.submit(pass)
---
---**Both** draws will use `data2` here!  That's because `lovr.graphics.submit` is where the draws actually get processed, so they both see the "final" state of the buffer.  The data in a Buffer can't be 2 things at once!  If you need multiple versions of data, it's best to use a bigger buffer with offsets (or multiple buffers).
---@class Buffer
local Buffer = {}

---Clears a range of data in the Buffer to a value.
---
---@param offset? number The offset of the range of the Buffer to clear, in bytes.  Must be a multiple of 4.
---@param extent? number The number of bytes to clear.  If `nil`, clears to the end of the Buffer.  Must be a multiple of 4.
---@param value? number The value to clear to.  This will be interpreted as a 32 bit number, which will be repeated across the clear range.
function Buffer:clear(offset, extent, value) end

---Downloads the Buffer's data from VRAM and returns it as a table.  This function is very very slow because it stalls the CPU until the data is finished downloading, so it should only be used for debugging or non-interactive scripts.  `Buffer:newReadback` is an alternative that returns a `Readback` object, which will not block the CPU.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The length of the table will equal the number of items read.  Here are some examples of how the table is formatted:
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('int', { 7 })
---    buffer:getData() --> returns { 7 }
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('vec3', { 7, 8, 9 })
---    buffer:getData() --> returns {{ 7, 8, 9 }}
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('int', { 1, 2, 3 })
---    buffer:getData() --> returns { 1, 2, 3 }
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({ 'vec2', 'vec2' }, {
---      vec2(1,2), vec2(3,4),
---      vec2(5,6), vec2(7,8)
---    })
---    buffer:getData() --> returns { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6, 7, 8 } }
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---      { 'a', 'float' },
---      { 'b', 'float' }
---    }, { a = 1, b = 2 })
---    buffer:getData() --> returns { { 1, 2 } }
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---      { 'x', 'int', 3 }
---    }, { x = { 1, 2, 3 } })
---    buffer:getData() --> returns { { x = { 1, 2, 3 } } }
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---      { 'lights', {
---        { 'pos', 'vec3' },
---        { 'size', 'float' },
---      }, 10}
---    }, data)
---    buffer:getData() --> returns { { lights = { { pos = ..., size = ... }, ... } } }
---
---In summary, each individual item is wrapped in a table, except if the format is a single number. If the format has nested types or arrays then the tables will be key-value, otherwise they will use numeric keys.
---
---@param index? number The index of the first item to read.
---@param count? number The number of items to read.  If nil, reads the remainder of the buffer.
---@return table t The table with the Buffer's data.
function Buffer:getData(index, count) end

---Returns the format the Buffer was created with.
---
---#### Example:
---
---```lua
---function lovr.load()
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---    { 'a', 'float' },
---    { 'b', 'un16x2' }
---  })
---
---  for i, field in ipairs(buffer:getFormat()) do
---    print(('%s: %s'):format(field.name, field.type))
---  end
---
---  -- prints the following:
---  -- a: f32
---  -- b: un16x2
---end
---```
---
---@return table format A list of fields comprising the format.
function Buffer:getFormat() end

---Returns the length of the Buffer, or `nil` if the Buffer was not created with a format.
---
---@return number length The length of the Buffer.
function Buffer:getLength() end

---Returns a pointer to GPU memory and schedules a copy from this pointer to the buffer's data. The data in the pointer will replace the data in the buffer.  This is intended for use with the LuaJIT FFI or for passing to C libraries.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The pointer remains valid until the next call to `lovr.graphics.submit`, during which the data in the pointer will be uploaded to the buffer.
---
---The initial contents of the pointer are undefined.
---
---Special care should be taken when writing data:
---
---- Reading data from the pointer will be very slow on some systems, and should be avoided.
---- It is better to write data to the pointer sequentially.  Random access may be slower.
---
---@param offset? number A byte offset in the buffer to write to.
---@param extent? number The number of bytes to replace.  If nil, writes to the rest of the buffer.
---@return lightuserdata pointer A pointer to the Buffer's memory.
function Buffer:getPointer(offset, extent) end

---Returns the size of the Buffer in VRAM, in bytes.  This is the same as `length * stride`.
---
---The size of the Buffer can't change after it's created.
---
---@return number size The size of the Buffer, in bytes.
function Buffer:getSize() end

---Returns the distance between each item in the Buffer, in bytes, or `nil` if the Buffer was not created with a format.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---When a Buffer is created, the stride can be set explicitly, otherwise it will be automatically computed based on the fields in the Buffer.
---
---Strides can not be zero, and can not be smaller than the size of a single item.
---
---@return number stride The stride of the Buffer, in bytes.
function Buffer:getStride() end

---Returns whether the Buffer is temporary.
---
---@return boolean temporary Whether the Buffer is temporary.
function Buffer:isTemporary() end

---Returns a pointer to GPU memory and schedules a copy from this pointer to the buffer's data. The data in the pointer will replace the data in the buffer.  This is intended for use with the LuaJIT FFI or for passing to C libraries.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The pointer remains valid until the next call to `lovr.graphics.submit`, during which the data in the pointer will be uploaded to the buffer.
---
---The initial contents of the pointer are undefined.
---
---Special care should be taken when writing data:
---
---- Reading data from the pointer will be very slow on some systems, and should be avoided.
---- It is better to write data to the pointer sequentially.  Random access may be slower.
---
---@param offset? number A byte offset in the buffer to write to.
---@param extent? number The number of bytes to replace.  If nil, writes to the rest of the buffer.
---@return lightuserdata pointer A pointer to the Buffer's memory.
function Buffer:mapData(offset, extent) end

---Creates and returns a new `Readback` that will download the data in the Buffer from VRAM. Once the readback is complete, `Readback:getData` returns the data as a table, or `Readback:getBlob` returns the data as a `Blob`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The offset and extent arguments must be a multiple of the Buffer's stride (unless it was created without a format).
---
---@param offset? number A byte offset to read from.
---@param extent? number The number of bytes to read.  If nil, reads the rest of the buffer.
---@return Readback readback A new Readback object.
function Buffer:newReadback(offset, extent) end

---Copies data to the Buffer from either a table, `Blob`, or `Buffer`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---One gotcha is that unspecified fields will be set to zero.  Here's an example:
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({{ 'x', 'int' }, { 'y', 'int' }})
---    buffer:setData({ x = 1, y = 1 }) -- set the data
---    buffer:setData({ x = 1 }) -- set the data, partially
---    -- buffer data is now {x=1, y=0}!
---
---This doesn't apply to separate items in the buffer.  For example, if the Buffer's length is 2 and only the 1st item is set, the second item will remain undisturbed:
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({{ 'x', 'int' }, { 'y', 'int' }}, 2)
---    buffer:setData({{ x = 1, y = 1 }, { x = 2, y = 2 }}) -- set the data
---    buffer:setData({{ x = 1 }}) -- set one item, partially
---    -- buffer data is now {{x=1, y=0}, {x=2, y=2}}

---One gotcha is that unspecified fields will be set to zero.  Here's an example:
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({{ 'x', 'int' }, { 'y', 'int' }})
---    buffer:setData({ x = 1, y = 1 }) -- set the data
---    buffer:setData({ x = 1 }) -- set the data, partially
---    -- buffer data is now {x=1, y=0}!
---
---This doesn't apply to separate items in the buffer.  For example, if the Buffer's length is 2 and only the 1st item is set, the second item will remain undisturbed:
---
---    buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({{ 'x', 'int' }, { 'y', 'int' }}, 2)
---    buffer:setData({{ x = 1, y = 1 }, { x = 2, y = 2 }}) -- set the data
---    buffer:setData({{ x = 1 }}) -- set one item, partially
---    -- buffer data is now {{x=1, y=0}, {x=2, y=2}}
---
---#### Example:
---
---Various examples of copying different formats.
---
---```lua
---function lovr.load()
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('int', 3)
---  buffer:setData({ 1, 2, 3 })
---
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('vec3', 2)
---  buffer:setData({ 1,2,3, 4,5,6 })
---  buffer:setData({ { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 } })
---  buffer:setData({ vec3(1, 2, 3), vec3(4, 5, 6) })
---
---  -- When the Buffer's length is 1, wrapping in table is optional:
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('vec3')
---  buffer:setData(1, 2, 3)
---  buffer:setData(vec3(1, 2, 3))
---
---  -- Same for key-value structs
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---    { 'x', 'float' },
---    { 'y', 'float' }
---  })
---  buffer:setData({ x = 1, y = 2 })
---
---  -- Key/value formats
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---    { 'x', 'float' },
---    { 'y', 'float' }
---  }, 3)
---  buffer:setData({
---    { x = 1, y = 2 },
---    { x = 3, y = 4 },
---    { x = 5, y = 6 }
---  })
---  buffer:setData({ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 })
---  buffer:setData({ { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 }, { 5, 6 } })
---
---  -- Nested formats
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---    { 'a', {
---      {'b', {
---        'c', 'float'
---      }}
---    }}
---  })
---  buffer:setData({ a = { b = { c = 42 } } })
---
---  -- Inner arrays
---  buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer({
---    { 'positions', 'vec3', 10 },
---    { 'sizes', 'float', 10 },
---    layout = 'std140'
---  })
---  local data = { positions = {}, sizes = {} }
---  for i = 1, buffer:getLength() do
---    data.positions[i] = vec3(i, i, i)
---    data.sizes[i] = i
---  end
---  buffer:setData(data)
---end
---```
---
---@param buffer Buffer The Buffer to copy data from.
---@param destinationOffset? number The byte offset to copy to.
---@param sourceOffset? number The byte offset to copy from.
---@param size? number The number of bytes to copy.  If nil, copies as many bytes as possible.
function Buffer:setData(buffer, destinationOffset, sourceOffset, size) end

---Font objects are used to render text with `Pass:text`.  The active font can be changed using `Pass:setFont`.  The default font is Varela Round, which is used when no font is active, and can be retrieved using `lovr.graphics.getDefaultFont`.  Custom fonts can be loaded from TTF files using `lovr.graphics.newFont`.
---
---Each Font uses a `Rasterizer` to load the TTF file and create images for each glyph. As text is drawn, the Font uploads images from the Rasterizer to a GPU texture atlas as needed.  The Font also performs text layout and mesh generation for strings of text.
---
---LÖVR uses a text rendering technique called "multichannel signed distance fields" (MSDF), which makes the font rendering remain crisp when text is viewed up close.
---@class Font
local Font = {}

---Returns the ascent of the font.  The ascent is the maximum amount glyphs ascend above the baseline.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.
---
---@return number ascent The ascent of the font.
function Font:getAscent() end

---Returns the descent of the font.  The descent is the maximum amount glyphs descend below the baseline.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.
---
---@return number descent The descent of the font.
function Font:getDescent() end

---Returns the height of the font, sometimes also called the leading.  This is the full height of a line of text, including the space between lines.  Each line of a multiline string is separated on the y axis by this height, multiplied by the font's line spacing.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.
---
---@return number height The height of the font.
function Font:getHeight() end

---Returns the kerning between 2 glyphs.  Kerning is a slight horizontal adjustment between 2 glyphs to improve the visual appearance.  It will often be negative.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.
---
---@param first string The first character.
---@param second string The second character.
---@return number keming The kerning between the two glyphs.
function Font:getKerning(first, second) end

---Returns the kerning between 2 glyphs.  Kerning is a slight horizontal adjustment between 2 glyphs to improve the visual appearance.  It will often be negative.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.

---@param second string The second character.
---@return number keming The kerning between the two glyphs.
function Font:getKerning(firstCodepoint, second) end

---Returns the kerning between 2 glyphs.  Kerning is a slight horizontal adjustment between 2 glyphs to improve the visual appearance.  It will often be negative.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.
---
---@param first string The first character.
---@param secondCodepoint number The second codepoint.
---@return number keming The kerning between the two glyphs.
function Font:getKerning(first, secondCodepoint) end

---Returns the kerning between 2 glyphs.  Kerning is a slight horizontal adjustment between 2 glyphs to improve the visual appearance.  It will often be negative.  The units depend on the font's pixel density.  With the default density, the units correspond to meters.
---
---@param firstCodepoint number The first codepoint.
---@param secondCodepoint number The second codepoint.
---@return number keming The kerning between the two glyphs.
function Font:getKerning(firstCodepoint, secondCodepoint) end

---Returns the line spacing of the Font.  When spacing out lines, the height of the font is multiplied the line spacing to get the final spacing value.  The default is 1.0.
---
---@return number spacing The line spacing of the font.
function Font:getLineSpacing() end

---Returns a table of wrapped lines for a piece of text, given a line length limit.  Newlines are handled correctly.  The wrap limit units depend on the pixel density of the font.  With the default pixel density, the units correspond to meters when the font is drawn at 1.0 scale.
---
---@param string string The text to wrap.
---@param wrap number The line length to wrap at.
---@return table lines A table strings, one for each wrapped line (without any color information).
function Font:getLines(string, wrap) end

---Returns a table of wrapped lines for a piece of text, given a line length limit.  Newlines are handled correctly.  The wrap limit units depend on the pixel density of the font.  With the default pixel density, the units correspond to meters when the font is drawn at 1.0 scale.
---
---@param strings table A table of colored strings, each given as a `{ color, string }` pair.  The color can be a `Vec3`, `Vec4`, table, or hexcode.
---@param wrap number The line length to wrap at.
---@return table lines A table strings, one for each wrapped line (without any color information).
function Font:getLines(strings, wrap) end

---Returns the pixel density of the font.  The density is a "pixels per world unit" factor that controls how the pixels in the font's texture are mapped to units in the coordinate space.
---
---The default pixel density is set to the height of the font.  This means that lines of text rendered with a scale of 1.0 come out to 1 unit (meter) tall.  However, if this font was drawn to a 2D texture where the units are in pixels, the font would still be drawn 1 unit (pixel) tall!  Scaling the coordinate space or the size of the text by the height of the font would fix this.  However, a more convenient option is to set the pixel density of the font to 1.0 when doing 2D rendering to make the font's size match up with the pixels of the canvas.
---
---@return number density The pixel density of the font.
function Font:getPixelDensity() end

---Returns the Rasterizer object backing the Font.
---
---@return Rasterizer rasterizer The Rasterizer.
function Font:getRasterizer() end

---Returns a table of vertices for a piece of text, along with a Material to use when rendering it. The Material returned by this function may not be the same if the Font's texture atlas needs to be recreated with a bigger size to make room for more glyphs.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Each vertex is a table of 4 floating point numbers with the following data:
---
---    { x, y, u, v }
---
---These could be placed in a vertex buffer using the following buffer format:
---
---    { 'vec2:VertexPosition', 'vec2:VertexUV' }
---
---@param string string The text to render.

---
---@param spacing number The new line spacing.
function Font:setLineSpacing(spacing) end

---Sets the pixel density of the font.  The density is a "pixels per world unit" factor that controls how the pixels in the font's texture are mapped to units in the coordinate space.
---
---The default pixel density is set to the height of the font.  This means that lines of text rendered with a scale of 1.0 come out to 1 unit (meter) tall.

function Font:setPixelDensity() end

---Materials are a set of properties and textures that define the properties of a surface, like what color it is, how bumpy or shiny it is, etc. `Shader` code can use the data from a material to compute lighting.
---
---Materials are immutable, and can't be changed after they are created.  Instead, a new Material should be created with the updated properties.
---
---`Pass:setMaterial` changes the active material, causing it to affect rendering until the active material is changed again.
---
---Using material objects is optional.  `Pass:setMaterial` can take a `Texture`, and `Pass:setColor` can change the color of objects, so basic tinting and texturing of surfaces does not require a full material to be created.  Also, a custom material system could be developed by sending textures and other data to shaders manually.
---
---`Model` objects will create materials for all of the materials defined in the model file.
---
---In shader code, non-texture material properties can be accessed as `Material.<property>`, and material textures can be accessed as `<Type>Texture`, e.g. `RoughnessTexture`.
---@class Material
local Material = {}

---Returns the properties of the Material in a table.
---
---@return table properties The Material properties.
function Material:getProperties() end

---Meshes store arbitrary geometry data, and can be drawn with `Pass:draw`.
---
---Meshes hold a list of **vertices**.  The number of vertices is declared upfront when the Mesh is created, and it can not be resized afterwards.
---
---The Mesh has a **vertex format**, which is a set of **attributes** comprising each vertex, like a `position`, `color`, etc.
---
---The **vertex indices** in the Mesh describe the order that the vertices are rendered in.  This is an optimization that allows vertices to be reused if they are used for multiple triangles, without duplicating all of their data.
---
---The Mesh has a **draw mode**, which controls how the vertices are connected together to create pixels.  It can either be `points`, `lines`, or `triangles`.
---
---The Mesh can have a `Material` applied, which defines colors, textures, and other properties of its surface.
---
---The **draw range** of the Mesh defines a subset of the vertices to render when the Mesh is drawn.
---
---The **bounding box** of the Mesh allows LÖVR to skip rendering it when it's out of view.
---@class Mesh
local Mesh = {}

---Computes the axis-aligned bounding box of the Mesh from its vertices.
---
---If the Mesh was created with the `gpu` storage mode, this function will do nothing and return `false`.
---
---If the Mesh does not have an attribute named `VertexPosition` with the `f32x3` (aka `vec3`) type, this function will do nothing and return `false`.
---
---Otherwise, the bounding box will be set and the return value will be `true`.
---
---The bounding box can also be assigned manually using `Mesh:setBoundingBox`, which can be used to set the bounding box on a `gpu` mesh or for cases where the bounding box is already known.
---
---Passes will use the bounding box of a Mesh to cull it against the cameras when `Pass:setViewCull` is enabled, which avoids rendering it when it's out of view.
---
---@return boolean updated Whether the bounding box was updated.
function Mesh:computeBoundingBox() end

---Returns the axis-aligned bounding box of the Mesh, or `nil` if the Mesh doesn't have a bounding box.
---
---Meshes with the `cpu` storage mode can compute their bounding box automatically using `Mesh:computeBoundingBox`.  The bounding box can also be set manually using `Mesh:setBoundingBox`.
---
---Passes will use the bounding box of a Mesh to cull it against the cameras when `Pass:setViewCull` is enabled, which avoids rendering it when it's out of view.
---
---@return number minx The minimum x coordinate of the bounding box.
---@return number maxx The maximum x coordinate of the bounding box.
---@return number miny The minimum y coordinate of the bounding box.
---@return number maxy The maximum y coordinate of the bounding box.
---@return number minz The minimum z coordinate of the bounding box.
---@return number maxz The maximum z coordinate of the bounding box.
function Mesh:getBoundingBox() end

---Returns the `DrawMode` of the mesh, which controls how the vertices in the Mesh are connected together to create pixels.  The default is `triangles`.
---
---@return DrawMode mode The current draw mode.
function Mesh:getDrawMode() end

---Returns the `Buffer` object that holds the data for the vertex indices in the Mesh.
---
---This can be `nil` if the Mesh doesn't have any indices.
---
---If a Mesh uses the `cpu` storage mode, the index buffer is internal to the `Mesh` and this function will return `nil`.  This ensures that the CPU data for the Mesh does not get out of sync with the GPU data in the Buffer.
---
---@return Buffer buffer The index buffer.
function Mesh:getIndexBuffer() end

---Returns a table with the Mesh's vertex indices.
---
---#### Notes:
---

function Mesh:getVertexBuffer() end

---Returns the number of vertices in the Mesh.  The vertex count is set when the Mesh is created and can't change afterwards.
---
---@return number count The number of vertices in the Mesh.
function Mesh:getVertexCount() end

---Returns the vertex format of the Mesh, which is a list of "attributes" that make up the data for each vertex (position, color, UV, etc.).
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If no vertex format is given when the Mesh is created, it will use a default format:
---
---    {
---      { 'VertexPosition', 'vec3', 0 },
---      { 'VertexNormal', 'vec3', 12 },
---      { 'VertexUV', 'vec2', 24 }
---    }
---
---The name of the vertex attribute corresponds to an `in` input variable in a vertex shader.
---
---There are a few built-in attributes that all shaders will understand and use by default:
---
---<table>
---  <thead>
---    <tr>
---      <td>Name</td>
---      <td>Description</td>

---Returns the vertices in the Mesh.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---> **This function will be very very slow if the storage mode of the Mesh is `gpu`, because the

---Sets or removes the axis-aligned bounding box of the Mesh.

---Changes the `DrawMode` of the mesh, which controls how the vertices in the Mesh are connected together to create pixels.  The default is `triangles`.
---
---@param mode DrawMode The current draw mode.
function Mesh:setDrawMode(mode) end

---Sets a `Buffer` object the Mesh will use for vertex indices.
---
---This can only be used if the Mesh uses the `gpu` storage mode.
---
---The Buffer must have a single field with the `u16`, `u32`, `index16`, or `index32` type.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The index buffer stores a list of numbers where each number is the index of a vertex in the Mesh.  When drawing the Mesh, the data from the vertex corresponding to the index is used.  This can be used to reorder or reuse vertices, which uses less data than repeating a vertex multiple times in the Mesh.
---
---#### Example:
---
---Use an index buffer to draw a plane.
---
---```lua
---function lovr.load()
---  mesh = lovr.graphics.newMesh({
---    { -1,  1, 0 }, -- upper left
---    {  1,  1, 0 }, -- upper right
---    { -1, -1, 0 }, -- lower left
---    {  1, -1, 0 }, -- lower right
---  }, 'gpu')
---
---  -- 2 triangles
---  local indices = { 1,3,2, 2,3,4 }
---
---  local indexBuffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('index16', indices)
---  mesh:setIndexBuffer(indexBuffer)
---end
---
---function lovr.draw(pass)
---  pass:draw(mesh, 0, 1.7, -2)
---end
---```
---
---@return Buffer buffer The index buffer.
function Mesh:setIndexBuffer() end

---Sets or clears the vertex indices of the Mesh.  Vertex indices define the list of triangles in the mesh.  They allow vertices to be reused multiple times without duplicating all their data, which can save a lot of memory and processing time if a vertex is used for multiple triangles.
---
---If a Mesh doesn't have vertex indices, then the vertices are rendered in order.
---
---@param t table A list of numbers (1-based).
function Mesh:setIndices(t) end

---Sets or clears the vertex indices of the Mesh.  Vertex indices define the list of triangles in the mesh.  They allow vertices to be reused multiple times without duplicating all their data, which can save a lot of memory and processing time if a vertex is used for multiple triangles.

---@param type DataType The type of index data in the Blob.  Must be `u16` or `u32`.
function Mesh:setIndices(blob, type) end

---Sets or clears the vertex indices of the Mesh.  Vertex indices define the list of triangles in the mesh.  They allow vertices to be reused multiple times without duplicating all their data, which can save a lot of memory and processing time if a vertex is used for multiple triangles.
---
---If a Mesh doesn't have vertex indices, then the vertices are rendered in order.
---
function Mesh:setIndices() end

---Sets a `Material` to use when drawing the Mesh.
---
---@param material Material The material to use.
function Mesh:setMaterial(material) end

---Sets a `Material` to use when drawing the Mesh.
---
---@param texture Texture The texture to use as the material.
function Mesh:setMaterial(texture) end

---Sets the data for vertices in the Mesh.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---CPU meshes will write the data to CPU memory and upload any changes to the GPU before the Mesh is drawn.  GPU meshes don't store this CPU copy of the data, and will immediately upload the new vertex data to VRAM.  This means that multiple calls to this function might be slower on a `gpu` mesh.
---
---@param vertices table A table of vertices, where each vertex is a table of numbers matching the vertex format of the Mesh.
---@param index? number The index of the first vertex to return.
---@param count? number The number of vertices to return.  If nil, returns the "rest" of the vertices, based on the `index` argument.
function Mesh:setVertices(vertices, index, count) end

---Sets the data for vertices in the Mesh.

---
---@param blob Blob A Blob containing binary vertex data.
---@param index? number The index of the first vertex to return.
---@param count? number The number of vertices to return.  If nil, returns the "rest" of the vertices, based on the `index` argument.
function Mesh:setVertices(blob, index, count) end

---Models are 3D model assets loaded from files.  Currently, OBJ, glTF, and binary STL files are supported.
---
---A model can be drawn using `Pass:draw`.
---
---The raw CPU data for a model is held in a `ModelData` object, which can be loaded on threads or reused for multiple Model instances.
---
---Models have a hierarchy of nodes which can have their transforms modified.  Meshes are attached to these nodes.  The same mesh can be attached to multiple nodes, allowing it to be drawn multiple times while only storing a single copy of its data.
---
---Models can have animations.  Animations have keyframes which affect the transforms of nodes. Right now each model can only be drawn with a single animated pose per frame.

---Models can have materials, which are collections of properties and textures that define how its surface is affected by lighting.  Each mesh in the model can use a single material.
---@class Model
local Model = {}

---Animates a Model by setting or blending the transforms of nodes using data stored in the keyframes of an animation.
---
---The animation from the model file is evaluated at the timestamp, resulting in a set of node properties.  These properties are then applied to the nodes in the model, using an optional blend factor.  If the animation doesn't have keyframes that target a given node, the node will remain unchanged.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If the timestamp is larger than the duration of the animation, it will wrap back around to zero, so looping an animation doesn't require using the modulo operator.
---
---To change the speed of the animation, multiply the timestamp by a speed factor.
---
---For each animated property in the animation, if the timestamp used for the animation is less than the timestamp of the first keyframe, the data of the first keyframe will be used.
---
---This function can be called multiple times to layer and blend animations.  The model joints will be drawn in the final resulting pose.
---
---`Model:resetNodeTransforms` can be used to reset the model nodes to their initial transforms, which is helpful to ensure animating starts from a clean slate.
---
---@param name string The name of an animation in the model file.
---@param time number The timestamp to evaluate the keyframes at, in seconds.
---@param blend? number How much of the animation's pose to blend into the nodes, from 0 to 1.

---Pass objects record work for the GPU.  They contain a list of things to draw and a list of compute shaders to run.
---
---Methods like `Pass:sphere` will "record" a draw on the Pass, which adds it to the list.  Other methods like `Pass:setBlendMode` or `Pass:setShader` will change the way the next draws are processed.
---
---Once all of the work has been recorded to a Pass, it can be sent to the GPU using `lovr.graphics.submit`, which will start processing all of the compute work and draws (in that order).
---
---A Pass can have a canvas, which is a set of textures that the draws will render to.
---
---`Pass:reset` is used to clear all of the computes and draws, putting the Pass in a fresh state.
---
---`lovr.draw` is called every frame with a `Pass` that is configured to render to either the headset or the window.  The Pass will automatically get submitted afterwards.
---@class Pass
local Pass = {}

---Synchronizes compute work.
---
---By default, within a single Pass, multiple calls to `Pass:compute` can run on the GPU in any order, or all at the same time.  This is great because it lets the GPU process the work as efficiently as possible, but sometimes multiple compute dispatches need to be sequenced.
---
---Calling this function will insert a barrier.  All compute operations on the Pass after the barrier will only start once all of the previous compute operations on the Pass are finished.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---It's only necessary to use a barrier if a compute shader is reading/writing the same bytes of memory that a previous compute operation in the same Pass read/wrote.
---
---Barriers will slow things down because they reduce parallelism by causing the GPU to wait. Strategic reordering of non-dependent :compute calls around the barrier can help.
---
---Calling this function before recording any :computes will do nothing, and calling it after the last :compute will do nothing.
---
---#### Example:
---
---```lua
---pass = lovr.graphics.newPass()
---pass:setShader(computeShader)
---
---pass:compute(x, y, z)
---pass:compute(x, y, z)
---pass:barrier()
---pass:compute(x, y, z) --> waits for the previous 2 :computes to complete
---```
---
function Pass:barrier() end

---Begins a new tally.  The tally will count the number of pixels touched by any draws that occur while the tally is active.  If a pixel fails the depth test or stencil test then it won't be counted, so the tally is a way to detect if objects are visible.
---
---The results for all the tallies in the pass can be copied to a `Buffer` when the Pass finishes by setting a buffer with `Pass:setTallyBuffer`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---There is currently a maximum of 256 tallies per pass.
---
---If a tally is already active, this function will error.
---
---@return number index The index of the tally that was started.

---Runs a compute shader.  There must be an active compute shader set using `Pass:setShader`.
---
---All of the compute shader dispatches in a Pass will run **before** all of the draws in the Pass (if any).  They will also run at the same time in parallel, unless `Pass:barrier` is used to control the order.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Compute shaders are usually run once for each pixel in an image, once per particle, once per object, etc.  The 3 arguments represent how many times to run, or "dispatch", the compute shader, in up to 3 dimensions.  Each element of this grid is called a **workgroup**.
---
---To make things even more complicated, each workgroup itself is made up of a set of "mini GPU threads", which are called **local workgroups**.  Like workgroups, the local workgroup size can also be 3D.  It's declared in the shader code, like this:
---
---    layout(local_size_x = w, local_size_y = h, local_size_z = d) in;
---
---All these 3D grids can get confusing, but the basic idea is to make the local workgroup size a small block of e.g. 32 particles or 8x8 pixels or 4x4x4 voxels, and then dispatch however many workgroups are needed to cover a list of particles, image, voxel field, etc.
---
---The reason to do it this way is that the GPU runs its threads in little fixed-size bundles called subgroups.  Subgroups are usually 32 or 64 threads (the exact size is given by the `subgroupSize` property of `lovr.graphics.getDevice`) and all run together.  If the local workgroup size was `1x1x1`, then the GPU would only run 1 thread per subgroup and waste the other 31 or 63.  So for the best performance, be sure to set a local workgroup size bigger than 1!
---
---Inside the compute shader, a few builtin variables can be used to figure out which workgroup is running:
---
---- `uvec3 WorkgroupCount` is the workgroup count per axis (the `Pass:compute` arguments).
---- `uvec3 WorkgroupSize` is the local workgroup size (declared in the shader).
---- `uvec3 WorkgroupID` is the index of the current (global) workgroup.
---- `uvec3 LocalThreadID` is the index of the local workgroup inside its workgroup.
---- `uint LocalThreadIndex` is a 1D version of `LocalThreadID`.
---- `uvec3 GlobalThreadID` is the unique identifier for a thread within all workgroups in a
---  dispatch. It's equivalent to `WorkgroupID * WorkgroupSize + LocalThreadID` (usually what you
---  want!)
---
---Indirect compute dispatches are useful to "chain" compute shaders together, while keeping all of the data on the GPU.  The first dispatch can do some computation and write some results to buffers, then the second indirect dispatch can use the data in those buffers to know how many times it should run.  An example would be a compute shader that does some sort of object culling, writing the number of visible objects to a buffer along with the IDs of each one. Subsequent compute shaders can be indirectly dispatched to perform extra processing on the visible objects.  Finally, an indirect draw can be used to render them.
---

---function lovr.load()

---
function Pass:getCanvas() end

function Pass:getStats() end

---Returns the Buffer that tally results will be written to.  Each time the render pass finishes, the results of all the tallies will be copied to the Buffer at the specified offset.  The buffer can be used in a later pass in a compute shader, or the data in the buffer can be read back using e.g. `Buffer:newReadback`.
---
---If no buffer has been set, this function will return `nil`.

---@param invert boolean Whether the matrix should be inverted.
---@return Mat4 matrix The matrix containing the view pose.
function Pass:getViewPose(view, matrix, invert) end

---Returns the viewport, or `nil` if no viewport is set.  Everything rendered will get mapped to the rectangle defined by the viewport.  More specifically, this defines the transformation from normalized device coordinates to pixel coordinates.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The viewport will apply to all draws in a Pass when the pass is submitted.
---
---The viewport rectangle can use floating point numbers.
---
---A negative viewport height (with a y coordinate equal to the bottom of the viewport) can be used to flip the rendering vertically.

---@param count? number The number of vertices to render (or the number of indices, when using an index buffer). When `nil`, as many vertices or indices as possible will be drawn (based on the length of the Buffers and `start`).

---@param base? number A base offset to apply to vertex indices.
function Pass:mesh(vertices, indices, position, scales, orientation, start, count, instances, base) end

---Draws a mesh.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The index buffer defines the order the vertices are drawn in.  It can be used to reorder, reuse, or omit vertices from the mesh.
---
---When drawing without a vertex buffer, the `VertexIndex` variable can be used in shaders to compute the position of each vertex, possibly by reading data from other `Buffer` or `Texture` resources.
---
---The active `DrawMode` controls whether the vertices are drawn as points, lines, or triangles.
---
---The active `Material` is applied to the mesh.
---
---#### Example:
---
---```lua
---function lovr.load()
---  local vertices = {
---    vec3(  0,  .4, 0), vec4(1, 0, 0, 1),
---    vec3(-.5, -.4, 0), vec4(0, 1, 0, 1),

---
---#### Notes:
---

---Pops the transform or render state stack, restoring it to the state it was in when it was last pushed.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If a stack is popped without a corresponding push, the stack "underflows" which causes an error.
---
---@param stack? StackType The type of stack to pop.
function Pass:pop(stack) end

---Saves a copy of the transform or render states.  Further changes can be made to the transform or render states, and afterwards `Pass:pop` can be used to restore the original state.  Pushes and pops can be nested, but it's an error to pop without a corresponding push.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Each stack has a limit of the number of copies it can store.  There can be 16 transforms and 4 render states saved.

---Sends a value to a variable in the Pass's active `Shader`.  The active shader is changed using `Pass:setShader`.

---Sets the Pass's canvas.  The canvas is a set of textures that the Pass will draw to when it's submitted, along with configuration for the depth buffer and antialiasing.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Changing the canvas will reset the pass, as though `Pass:reset` was called.
---
---All textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and multisample counts.  They also must have been created with the `render` usage flag.
---
---The number of layers in the textures determines how many views (cameras) the pass has.  Each draw will be rendered to all texture layers, as seen from the corresponding camera.  For example, VR rendering will use a canvas texture with 2 layers, one for each eye.
---
---To render to a specific mipmap level or layer of a texture, use texture views (`Texture:newView`).
---
---Mipmaps will be regenerated for all of canvas textures at the end of a render pass.
---
---If the Pass has multiple color textures, a fragment shader should be used to write a different color to each texture.  Here's an example that writes red to the first texture and blue to the second texture:
---
---    // Declare an output variable for the second texture
---    layout(location = 1) out vec4 secondColor;

---
---@param ...textures Texture One or more color textures the pass will render to.

---Sets the Pass's canvas.  The canvas is a set of textures that the Pass will draw to when it's submitted, along with configuration for the depth buffer and antialiasing.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Changing the canvas will reset the pass, as though `Pass:reset` was called.
---
---All textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and multisample counts.  They also must have been created with the `render` usage flag.
---
---The number of layers in the textures determines how many views (cameras) the pass has.  Each draw will be rendered to all texture layers, as seen from the corresponding camera.  For example, VR rendering will use a canvas texture with 2 layers, one for each eye.
---
---To render to a specific mipmap level or layer of a texture, use texture views (`Texture:newView`).
---
---Mipmaps will be regenerated for all of canvas textures at the end of a render pass.
---
---If the Pass has multiple color textures, a fragment shader should be used to write a different color to each texture.  Here's an example that writes red to the first texture and blue to the second texture:
---
---    // Declare an output variable for the second texture
---    layout(location = 1) out vec4 secondColor;
---
---    vec4 lovrmain() {
---      secondColor = vec4(0, 0, 1, 1);
---      return vec4(1, 0, 0, 1);
---    }
---
---@param canvas? {depth: any, samples: number} The canvas.  Each numeric key is a color texture to render to (up to 4), along with the following keys to control depth buffer and antialiasing settings:
function Pass:setCanvas(canvas) end

---Sets the Pass's canvas.  The canvas is a set of textures that the Pass will draw to when it's submitted, along with configuration for the depth buffer and antialiasing.

---      return vec4(1, 0, 0, 1);
---    }
---
function Pass:setCanvas() end

---Sets the clear values of the pass.  This controls the initial colors of the canvas texture pixels at the beginning of the render pass.  For each color texture, it can be one of the following:
---
---- A specific RGBA color value (or number for the depth texture).
---- `true`, to do a "fast clear" to undefined values.  This is useful if the pass is going to end
---  up drawing to all of the texture's pixels.
---- `false`, to avoid clearing and load the texture's existing pixels.  This can be slow on mobile
---  GPUs.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If the depth clear is not given, it will be set to 0.
---
---All clear colors will default to transparent black (all zeros) when the Pass is created.
---
---@param hex number A hexcode color to clear all color textures to.
function Pass:setClear(hex) end

function Pass:setClear(t) end

---The default color is `(1, 1, 1, 1)`.
---
---@param hex number A hexcode.
---@param a? number The alpha component of the color.
function Pass:setColor(hex, a) end

---Sets the color channels affected by drawing, on a per-channel basis.  Disabling color writes is often used to render to the depth or stencil buffer without affecting existing pixel colors.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---By default, color writes are enabled for all channels.
---
---@param enable boolean Whether all color components should be affected by draws.
function Pass:setColorWrite(enable) end

---Sets the color channels affected by drawing, on a per-channel basis.  Disabling color writes is often used to render to the depth or stencil buffer without affecting existing pixel colors.
---
---#### Notes:

---Sets whether the front or back faces of triangles are culled.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---By default, face culling is disabled.
---
---@param mode CullMode Whether `front` faces, `back` faces, or `none` of the faces should be culled.
function Pass:setCullMode(mode) end

---Sets whether the front or back faces of triangles are culled.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---By default, face culling is disabled.
---
function Pass:setCullMode() end

---Enables or disables depth clamp.  Normally, when pixels fall outside of the clipping planes, they are clipped (not rendered).  Depth clamp will instead render these pixels, clamping their depth on to the clipping planes.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---This isn\'t supported on all GPUs.  Use the `depthClamp` feature of `lovr.graphics.getFeatures` to check for support.  If depth clamp is enabled when unsupported, it will silently fall back to depth clipping.
---
---Depth clamping is not enabled by default.
---
---@param enable boolean Whether depth clamp should be enabled.
function Pass:setDepthClamp(enable) end

---Set the depth offset.  This is a constant offset added to the depth value of pixels, as well as a "sloped" depth offset that is scaled based on the "slope" of the depth at the pixel.
---
---This can be used to fix Z fighting when rendering decals or other nearly-overlapping objects, and is also useful for shadow biasing when implementing shadow mapping.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The default depth offset is zero for both values.
---
---This only applies to triangles, not points or lines.
---
---The units for these offsets aren't specified very well -- they depend on the format of the depth texture, and the GPU can use them slightly differently for its depth calculations.  However, an `offset` of 1 will roughly correspond to the smallest-possible depth difference (e.g. 2^-16 for a `d16` depth texture).
---
---The sloped depth scale is multiplied by the slope of the depth of the triangle.  For example, if pixels in the triangle all have the same depth (i.e. the triangle is facing the camera), then the slope of the depth will be zero and the sloped depth offset won't have any effect.  As the triangle starts to face away from the camera, the slope of the depth will increase and the sloped depth offset will begin to apply.  This can also be thought of corresponding to the normal vector of the triangle relative to the camera.
---
---Note that the offsets can be negative.  With LÖVR's default projection matrix, depth values of zero are far away and one are close up, so positive depth offsets will push depth values "closer" to the viewer.  With flipped projection matrices (a depth test of `lequal`), negative depth offsets would be used instead.
---
---@param offset? number The depth offset.
---@param sloped? number The sloped depth offset.
function Pass:setDepthOffset(offset, sloped) end

---Sets the depth test.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---When using LÖVR's default projection (reverse Z with infinite far plane) the default depth test is `gequal`, depth values of 0.0 are on the far plane and depth values of 1.0 are on the near plane, closer to the camera.
---
---The near and far clipping planes are set with `Pass:setProjection`.  The default is set with `lovr.headset.setClipDistance`.
---
---A depth buffer must be present to use the depth test, but this is enabled by default.
---
---@param test CompareMode The new depth test to use.
function Pass:setDepthTest(test) end

---Sets the depth test.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---When using LÖVR's default projection (reverse Z with infinite far plane) the default depth test is `gequal`, depth values of 0.0 are on the far plane and depth values of 1.0 are on the near plane, closer to the camera.
---
---The near and far clipping planes are set with `Pass:setProjection`.  The default is set with `lovr.headset.setClipDistance`.
---
---A depth buffer must be present to use the depth test, but this is enabled by default.
---
function Pass:setDepthTest() end

---Sets whether draws write to the depth buffer.  When a pixel is drawn, if depth writes are enabled and the pixel passes the depth test, the depth buffer will be updated with the pixel's depth value.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The default depth write is `true`.
---
---@param write boolean Whether the depth buffer should be affected by draws.
function Pass:setDepthWrite(write) end

---Sets the font used for `Pass:text`.
---
---@param font Font The Font to use when rendering text.
function Pass:setFont(font) end

---Sets the material.  This will apply to most drawing, except for text, skyboxes, and models, which use their own materials.
---
---@param material Material The material to use for drawing.
function Pass:setMaterial(material) end

---Sets the material.  This will apply to most drawing, except for text, skyboxes, and models, which use their own materials.
---
---@param texture Texture The texture to use as the material.
function Pass:setMaterial(texture) end

---Sets the material.  This will apply to most drawing, except for text, skyboxes, and models, which use their own materials.
---
function Pass:setMaterial() end

---Changes the way vertices are connected together when drawing using `Pass:mesh`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The default mesh mode is `triangles`.
---
---@param mode DrawMode The mesh mode to use.
function Pass:setMeshMode(mode) end

---Sets the projection for a single view.  4 field of view angles can be used, similar to the field of view returned by `lovr.headset.getViewAngles`.  Alternatively, a projection matrix can be used for other types of projections like orthographic, oblique, etc.
---
---Up to 6 views are supported.  The Pass returned by `lovr.headset.getPass` will have its views automatically configured to match the headset.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---A far clipping plane of 0.0 can be used for an infinite far plane with reversed Z range.  This is the default because it improves depth precision and reduces Z fighting.  Using a non-infinite far plane requires the depth buffer to be cleared to 1.0 instead of 0.0 and the default depth test to be changed to `lequal` instead of `gequal`.
---
---By default, the projection is set by the headset.  Each HMD has a specific field of view given by `lovr.headset.getViewAngles`, and the clipping planes can be customized with `lovr.headset.setClipDistance`.
---
---@param view number The index of the view to update.
---@param left number The left field of view angle, in radians.
---@param right number The right field of view angle, in radians.
---@param up number The top field of view angle, in radians.
---@param down number The bottom field of view angle, in radians.
---@param near? number The near clipping plane distance, in meters.
---@param far? number The far clipping plane distance, in meters.

---@param matrix Mat4 The projection matrix for the view.
function Pass:setProjection(view, matrix) end

---Sets the default `Sampler` to use when sampling textures.  It is also possible to send a custom sampler to a shader using `Pass:send` and use that instead, which allows customizing the sampler on a per-texture basis.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The `getPixel` shader helper function will use this sampler.
---
---When a Pass is reset, its sampler will be reset to `linear`.
---
---The sampler applies to all draws in the pass on submit, regardless of when the sampler is set.
---
---#### Example:
---
---```lua
---function lovr.draw(pass)
---  pass:setSampler('nearest') -- activate minecraft mode
---  pass:setMaterial(rock)
---  pass:cube(x, y, z)
---end
---```
---
---@param filter? FilterMode The default filter mode to use when sampling textures (the `repeat` wrap mode will be used).
function Pass:setSampler(filter) end

---  pass:cube(x, y, z)
---end
---```
---
---@param sampler Sampler The default sampler shaders will use when reading from textures.
function Pass:setSampler(sampler) end

---Sets the scissor rectangle.  Any pixels outside the scissor rectangle will not be drawn.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The scissor will apply to all draws in a Pass when the pass is submitted, even if this function is called after adding the draws.
---
---`x` and `y` can not be negative.  `w` and `h` must be positive.
---
---By default, the scissor is disabled and will cover the entire render area.
---
---@param x number The x coordinate of the upper-left corner of the scissor rectangle.
---@param y number The y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the scissor rectangle.
---@param w number The width of the scissor rectangle.
---@param h number The height of the scissor rectangle.
function Pass:setScissor(x, y, w, h) end

---Sets the scissor rectangle.  Any pixels outside the scissor rectangle will not be drawn.

---
---By default, the scissor is disabled and will cover the entire render area.
---
function Pass:setScissor() end

---Sets the active shader.  In a render pass, the Shader will affect all drawing operations until it is changed again.  In a compute pass, the Shader will be run when `Pass:compute` is called.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Changing the shader will preserve resource bindings (the ones set using `Pass:send`) **unless** the new shader declares a resource for a binding number using a different type than the current shader.  In this case, the resource "type" means one of the following:
---
---- Uniform buffer (`uniform`).
---- Storage buffer (`buffer`).
---- Sampled texture, (`uniform texture<type>`).
---- Storage texture, (`uniform image<type>`).
---- Sampler (`uniform sampler`).
---
---If the new shader doesn't declare a resource in a particular binding number, any resource there will be preserved.
---
---If there's a clash in resource types like this, the variable will be "cleared".  Using a buffer variable that has been cleared is not well-defined, and may return random data or even crash the GPU.  For textures, white pixels will be returned.  Samplers will use `linear` filtering and the `repeat` wrap mode.
---
---Changing the shader will not clear push constants set in the `Constants` block.

---Sets the stencil test.  Any pixels that fail the stencil test won't be drawn.  For example, setting the stencil test to `('equal', 1)` will only draw pixels that have a stencil value of 1. The stencil buffer can be modified by drawing while stencil writes are enabled with `lovr.graphics.setStencilWrite`.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---The stencil test is disabled by default.
---
---Setting the stencil test requires the `Pass` to have a depth texture with the `d24s8` or `d32fs8` format (the `s` means "stencil").  The `t.graphics.stencil` and `t.headset.stencil` flags in `lovr.conf` can be used to request a stencil format for the default window and headset passes, respectively.
---

---#### Notes:
---
---View frustum culling is disabled by default.
---
---Objects will be culled against all views in the Pass.  The pose and projection for these views is controlled using `Pass:setViewPose` and `Pass:setProjection`.
---
---View frustum culling will increase CPU usage, but will reduce GPU usage depending on how many objects get culled and how many vertices they have.
---
---For most scenes that draw objects all around the camera, frustum culling will usually result in large speedups.  However, it's always good to measure to be sure.  For example, if every object drawn is in view, then frustum culling will only make things slower, because LÖVR will spend time checking if objects are in view without actually culling any of them.
---
---`Pass:getStats` will return `draws` and `drawsCulled` fields.  The `submitTime` and `gpuTime` fields (with `lovr.graphics.setTimingEnabled`) are a good way to measure the impact of culling.
---
---To cull an object against a view frustum, LÖVR needs to know the object's bounding box.  The following types of draws have bounding boxes:
---
---- `Pass:plane`
---- `Pass:roundrect`
---- `Pass:cube`
---- `Pass:box`
---- `Pass:circle`
---- `Pass:sphere`
---- `Pass:cylinder`
---- `Pass:cone`
---- `Pass:capsule`
---- `Pass:torus`
---- `Pass:draw` (see notes below for `Model` and `Mesh` objects)
---
---The following draws do **not** currently have bounding boxes, and will not be culled:
---
---- `Pass:points`
---- `Pass:line`
---- `Pass:text`
---- `Pass:skybox`
---- `Pass:fill`
---- `Pass:mesh`
---
---`Model` objects only compute their bounding box when they're loaded, using the initial node transforms. If a node's transform changes, either manually with `Model:setNodeTransform` or from an animation, then the bounding box will become out of sync and culling will not work properly. View culling should be disabled when rendering these models.
---
---`Mesh` objects will not have a bounding box by default.  Meshes with a storage type of `cpu` can compute their bounding boxes using `Mesh:computeBoundingBox`, which should be called after creating the Mesh or whenever its vertices change.  Any type of Mesh can have its bounding box set manually using `Mesh:setBoundingBox`.  This can be faster than `Mesh:computeBoundingBox` if the bounding box is already known, and is the only way to give a `gpu` Mesh a bounding box.

---Readbacks track the progress of an asynchronous read of a `Buffer` or `Texture`.  The Readback can be polled for completion or the CPU with `Readback:isComplete`, or you can wait for it to finish using `Readback:wait`.
---@class Readback
local Readback = {}

---Returns the Readback's data as a Blob.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If the Readback is reading back a Texture, returns `nil`.
---
---@return Blob blob The Blob.

---
---@return table data A table containing the data that was read back.

---Returns whether the Readback has completed on the GPU and its data is available.
---
---@return boolean complete Whether the readback is complete.
function Readback:isComplete() end

---Blocks the CPU until the Readback is finished on the GPU.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If `lovr.graphics.submit` or `lovr.graphics.wait` has not been called since the readback was created, the readback has not been submitted yet, so no wait will occur and this function will return `false`.
---
---@return boolean waited Whether the CPU had to be blocked for waiting.
function Readback:wait() end

---Samplers are objects that control how pixels are read from a texture.  They can control whether the pixels are smoothed, whether the texture wraps at the edge of its UVs, and more.
---
---Each `Pass` has a default sampler that will be used by default, which can be changed using `Pass:setSampler`.  Also, samplers can be declared in shaders using the following syntax:
---
---    layout(set = 2, binding = X) uniform sampler mySampler;
---
---A Sampler can be sent to the variable using `Pass:send('mySampler', sampler)`.
---
---The properties of a Sampler are immutable, and can't be changed after it's created.
---@class Sampler
local Sampler = {}

---Returns the anisotropy level of the Sampler.  Anisotropy smooths out a texture's appearance when viewed at grazing angles.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---Not all GPUs support anisotropy.  The maximum anisotropy level is given by the `anisotropy` limit of `lovr.graphics.getLimits`, which may be zero.  It's very common for the maximum to be 16, however.
---
---@return number anisotropy The anisotropy level of the sampler.
function Sampler:getAnisotropy() end

---Returns the compare mode of the Sampler.  This is a feature typically only used for shadow mapping.  Using a sampler with a compare mode requires it to be declared in a shader as a `samplerShadow` instead of a `sampler` variable, and used with a texture that has a depth format.  The result of sampling a depth texture with a shadow sampler is a number between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of sampled pixels that passed the comparison.
---
---@return CompareMode compare The compare mode of the sampler.
function Sampler:getCompareMode() end

---Returns the filter mode of the Sampler.
---
---@return FilterMode min The filter mode used when the texture is minified.
---@return FilterMode mag The filter mode used when the texture is magnified.
---@return FilterMode mip The filter mode used to select a mipmap level.
function Sampler:getFilter() end

---Returns the mipmap range of the Sampler.  This is used to clamp the range of mipmap levels that can be accessed from a texture.
---
---@return number min The minimum mipmap level that will be sampled (0 is the largest image).
---@return number max The maximum mipmap level that will be sampled.
function Sampler:getMipmapRange() end

---Returns the wrap mode of the sampler, used to wrap or clamp texture coordinates when the extend outside of the 0-1 range.
---
---@return WrapMode x The wrap mode used in the horizontal direction.
---@return WrapMode y The wrap mode used in the vertical direction.
---@return WrapMode z The wrap mode used in the "z" direction, for 3D textures only.
function Sampler:getWrap() end

---Shaders are small GPU programs.  See the `Shaders` guide for a full introduction to Shaders.
---@class Shader
local Shader = {}

---Clones a shader.  This creates an inexpensive copy of it with different flags.  It can be used to create several variants of a shader with different behavior.
---
---@param source Shader The Shader to clone.
---@param flags table The flags used by the clone.
---@return Shader shader The new Shader.
function Shader:clone(source, flags) end

---Returns the format of a buffer declared in shader code.  The return type matches the same syntax used by `lovr.graphics.newBuffer` and `Buffer:getFormat`, so it can be used to quickly create a Buffer that matches a variable from a Shader.
---
---#### Notes:
---
---If the buffer only has a single array field, the format will be "unwrapped" to an array instead of a single-field struct with an array in it.  Example:
---
---    shader = lovr.graphics.newShader([[
---      layout(set = 0, binding = 0) buffer Numbers {
---        uint numbers[64];
---      };
---
---      void lovrmain(){}
---    ]])
---
---    shader:getBufferFormat('Numbers')
---    -- returns {{ name = 'numbers', type = 'u32' }}, 64
---    -- not     {{ name = 'numbers', type = 'u32', length = 64 }}, 1
---
---Similarly, if the buffer only has a single struct field, the format will be "unwrapped" to the inner struct.  This lets you use a struct for a Buffer's data without having to wrap everything in an extra namespace.  Example:
---
---    shader = lovr.graphics.newShader([[
---      struct HandParams {
---        vec3 pos;
---        float grip;
---      };
---
---      layout(set = 0, binding = 0) buffer Hand {
---        HandParams params;
---      };
---
---      void lovrmain(){}
---    ]])
---
---    shader:getBufferFormat('Hand')
---    -- returns {{ name = 'pos', type = 'vec3' }, { name = 'grip', type = 'float' }}, 1
---    -- not     {{ name = 'params', type = {...}}}, 1
---
---#### Example:
---
---```lua
---shader = lovr.graphics.newShader([[
---  layout(set = 2, binding = 0) uniform Transforms {
---    mat4 transforms[32];
---  };
---
---  vec4 lovrmain() {
---    return Projection * View * transforms[InstanceIndex] * VertexPosition;
---  }
---]], 'unlit')
---
---local format, length = shader:getBufferFormat('Transforms')
---print(length) --> 32
---print(format[1].name) --> 'transforms'
---print(format[1].type) --> 'mat4'

---Creates a new Texture view.  A texture view does not store any pixels on its own, but instead uses the pixel data of a "parent" Texture object.  The width, height, format, sample count, and usage flags all match the parent.  The view may have a different `TextureType` from the parent, and it may reference a subset of the parent texture's layers and mipmap levels.
---
---Texture views can be used as render targets in a render pass and they can be bound to Shaders. They can not currently be used for transfer operations.  They are used for:

---The different ways to pack Buffer fields into memory.
---
---The default is `packed`, which is suitable for vertex buffers and index buffers.  It doesn't add any padding between elements, and so it doesn't waste any space.  However, this layout won't necessarily work for uniform buffers and storage buffers.
---
---The `std140` layout corresponds to the std140 layout used for uniform buffers in GLSL.  It adds the most padding between fields, and requires the stride to be a multiple of 16.  Example:
---
---    layout(std140) uniform ObjectScales { float scales[64]; };
---
---The `std430` layout corresponds to the std430 layout used for storage buffers in GLSL.  It adds some padding between certain types, and may round up the stride.  Example:
---
---    layout(std430) buffer TileSizes { vec2 sizes[]; }
---@alias DataLayout

---Different types for `Buffer` fields.  These are scalar, vector, or matrix types, usually packed into small amounts of space to reduce the amount of memory they occupy.
---
---The names are encoded as follows:
---
---- The data type:
---  - `i` for signed integer
---  - `u` for unsigned integer
---  - `sn` for signed normalized (-1 to 1)
---  - `un` for unsigned normalized (0 to 1)
---  - `f` for floating point

---The set of shaders built in to LÖVR.  These can be passed to `Pass:setShader` or `lovr.graphics.newShader` instead of writing GLSL code.  The shaders can be further customized by using the `flags` option to change their behavior.  If the active shader is set to `nil`, LÖVR picks one of these shaders to use.
---@alias DefaultShader
---Basic shader without lighting that uses colors and a texture.
---| "unlit"
---Shades triangles based on their normal, resulting in a cool rainbow effect.
---| "normal"
---Renders font glyphs.
---| "font"
---Renders cubemaps.
---| "cubemap"
---Renders spherical textures.
---| "equirect"
---Renders a fullscreen triangle.
---| "fill"

---Different ways vertices in a mesh can be connected together and filled in with pixels.
---@alias DrawMode
---Each vertex is rendered as a single point.  The size of the point can be controlled using the `pointSize` shader flag, or by writing to the `PointSize` variable in shaders.  The maximum point size is given by the `pointSize` limit from `lovr.graphics.getLimits`.
---| "points"
---Pairs of vertices are connected with line segments.  To draw a single line through all of the vertices, an index buffer can be used to repeat vertices.  It is not currently possible to change the width of the lines, although cylinders or capsules can be used as an alternative.
---| "lines"
---Every 3 vertices form a triangle, which is filled in with pixels (unless `Pass:setWireframe` is used).  This mode is the most commonly used.
---| "triangles"

---Whether a shape should be drawn filled or outlined.
---@alias DrawStyle
---The shape will be filled in (the default).
---| "fill"
---The shape will be outlined.
---| "line"

---Controls how `Sampler` objects smooth pixels in textures.
---@alias FilterMode
---A pixelated appearance where the "nearest neighbor" pixel is used.
---| "nearest"
---A smooth appearance where neighboring pixels are averaged.
---| "linear"

---Different ways to horizontally align text with `Pass:text`.
---@alias HorizontalAlign
---Left-aligned text.

---Centered text.
---| "center"
---Right-aligned text.
---| "right"

---Whether a Mesh stores its data on the CPU or GPU.
---@alias MeshStorage
---The Mesh will store a copy of the vertices on the CPU.
---| "cpu"
---The Mesh will not keep a CPU copy, only storing vertices on the GPU.
---| "gpu"

---Different coordinate spaces for nodes in a `Model`.
---@alias OriginType
---Transforms are relative to the origin (root) of the Model.
---| "root"
---Transforms are relative to the parent of the node.
---| "parent"

---The three different types of `Pass` objects.  Each Pass has a single type, which determines the type of work it does and which functions can be called on it.
---@alias PassType
---A render pass renders graphics to a set of up to four color textures and an optional depth texture.  The textures all need to have the same dimensions and sample counts.  The textures can have multiple layers, and all rendering work will be broadcast to each layer.  Each layer can use a different camera pose, which is used for stereo rendering.
---| "render"
---A compute pass runs compute shaders.  Compute passes usually only call `Pass:setShader`, `Pass:send`, and `Pass:compute`.  All of the compute work in a single compute pass is run in parallel, so multiple compute passes should be used if one compute pass needs to happen after a different one.
---| "compute"
---A transfer pass copies data to and from GPU memory in `Buffer` and `Texture` objects. Transfer passes use `Pass:copy`, `Pass:clear`, `Pass:blit`, `Pass:mipmap`, and `Pass:read`. Similar to compute passes, all the work in a transfer pass happens in parallel, so multiple passes should be used if the transfers need to be ordered.
---| "transfer"

---Different shader stages.  Graphics shaders have a `vertex` and `fragment` stage, and compute shaders have a single `compute` stage.
---@alias ShaderStage
---The vertex stage, which computes transformed vertex positions.
---| "vertex"
---The fragment stage, which computes pixel colors.
---| "fragment"
---The compute stage, which performs arbitrary computation.
---| "compute"

---The two types of shaders that can be created.
---@alias ShaderType
---A graphics shader with a vertex and pixel stage.
---| "graphics"
---A compute shader with a single compute stage.
---| "compute"

---Different types of stacks that can be pushed and popped with `Pass:push` and `Pass:pop`.
---@alias StackType
---The transform stack (`Pass:transform`, `Pass:translate`, etc.).
---| "transform"
---Graphics state, like `Pass:setColor`, `Pass:setFont`, etc.  Notably this does not include camera poses/projections or shader variables changed with `Pass:send`.
---| "state"

---Different ways of updating the stencil buffer with `Pass:setStencilWrite`.
---@alias StencilAction
---Stencil buffer pixels will not be changed by draws.
---| "keep"
---Stencil buffer pixels will be set to zero.
---| "zero"
---Stencil buffer pixels will be replaced with a custom value.
---| "replace"
---Stencil buffer pixels will be incremented each time they're rendered to.
---| "increment"
---Stencil buffer pixels will be decremented each time they're rendered to.
---| "decrement"
---Similar to increment, but will wrap around to 0 when it exceeds 255.
---| "incrementwrap"
---Similar to decrement, but will wrap around to 255 when it goes below 0.
---| "decrementwrap"
---The bits in the stencil buffer pixels will be inverted.
---| "invert"

---These are the different ways `Texture` objects can be used.  These are passed in to `lovr.graphics.isFormatSupported` to see which texture operations are supported by the GPU for a given format.
---@alias TextureFeature
---The Texture can be sampled (e.g. a `texture2D` or `sampler2D` variable in shaders).
---| "sample"
---The Texture can be used with a `Sampler` using a `FilterMode` of `linear`.
---| "filter"
---The Texture can be rendered to by using it as a target in a render `Pass`.
---| "render"
---Blending can be enabled when rendering to this format in a render pass.
---| "blend"
---The Texture can be sent to an image variable in shaders (e.g. `image2D`).
---| "storage"
---Atomic operations can be used on storage textures with this format.
---| "atomic"
---Source textures in `Pass:blit` can use this format.
---| "blitsrc"
---Destination textures in `Pass:blit` can use this format.
---| "blitdst"

---Different types of textures.  Textures are multidimensional blocks of GPU memory, and the texture's type determines how many dimensions there are, and adds some semantics about what the 3rd dimension means.
---@alias TextureType
---A single 2D image, the most common type.
---| "2d"
---A 3D image, where a sequence of 2D images defines a 3D volume.  Each mipmap level of a 3D texture gets smaller in the x, y, and z axes, unlike cubemap and array textures.
---| "3d"
---Six square 2D images with the same dimensions that define the faces of a cubemap, used for skyboxes or other "directional" images.
---| "cube"
---Array textures are sequences of distinct 2D images that all have the same dimensions.
---| "array"

---These are the different things `Texture`s can be used for.  When creating a Texture, a set of these flags can be provided, restricting what operations are allowed on the texture.  Using a smaller set of flags may improve performance.  If none are provided, the only usage flag applied is `sample`.
---@alias TextureUsage
---Whether the texture can be sampled from in Shaders (i.e. used in a material, or bound to a variable with a `texture` type, like `texture2D`).
---| "sample"
---Whether the texture can be rendered to (i.e. by using it as a render target in `lovr.graphics.pass`).
---| "render"
---Whether the texture can be used as a storage texture for compute operations (i.e. bound to a variable with an `image` type, like `image2D`).
---| "storage"
---Whether the texture can be used for transfer operations like `Texture:setPixels`, `Texture:blit`, etc.
---| "transfer"

---Different ways to vertically align text with `Pass:text`.
---@alias VerticalAlign
---Top-aligned text.
