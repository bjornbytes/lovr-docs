---LÃ–VR includes Lua 5.3's `utf8` library, even on Lua versions that don't support it.  Lua's regular strings aren't utf8-aware, so this library makes it easier to work with multi-byte characters that are outside the ASCII range.

---See the [Lua reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.5) for documentation.
