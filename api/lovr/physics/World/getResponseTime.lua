    Returns the response time factor of the World.

    The response time controls how relaxed collisions and joints are in the physics simulation, and
    functions similar to inertia.  A low response time means collisions are resolved quickly, and
    higher values make objects more spongy and soft.

    The value can be any positive number.  It can be changed on a per-joint basis for
    `DistanceJoint` and `BallJoint` objects.
