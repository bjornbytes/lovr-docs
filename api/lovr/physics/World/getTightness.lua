    Returns the tightness of joints in the World.

    The tightness controls how much force is applied to colliders connected by joints.  With a value
    of 0, no force will be applied and joints won't have any effect.  With a tightness of 1, a
    strong force will be used to try to keep the Colliders constrained.  A tightness larger than 1
    will overcorrect the joints, which can sometimes be desirable.  Negative tightness values are
    not supported.
