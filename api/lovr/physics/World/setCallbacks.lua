  summary = 'Set the World\'s collision callbacks.',
  description = [[
    Assigns collision callbacks to the world.  These callbacks are used to filter collisions or get
    notifications when colliders start or stop touching.  Callbacks are called during
    `World:update`.

    ### Filter

    Filters collisions.  Receives two colliders and returns a boolean indicating if they should
    collide.  Note that it is much faster to use tags and `World:enableCollisionBetween` to control
    collision.  This should only be used when the logic for filtering the collision is highly
    dynamic.

    ### Enter

    Called when two colliders begin touching.  Receives two colliders and a `Contact` object with
    more information about the collision.  The `contact` callback will also be called for this
    collision.

    ### Exit

    Called when two colliders stop touching.  Receives two colliders.

    ### Contact

    Called continuously while two colliders are touching.  Receives two colliders and a `Contact`
    object with more information about the collision.  The contact can also be disabled to disable
    the collision response, and its friction/resitution/velocity can be changed.  There can be
    multiple active contact areas (called "manifolds") between a pair of colliders; this callback
    will be called for each one.
