    The damping ratio controls how quickly the oscillation slows down:

    - Undamped: Zero damping will cause the spring to oscillate forever.  (Note that the spring may
      still lose a small amount of energy over time).
    - Underdamped: Damping less than one results in a system that is underdamped.  The spring will
      oscillate around the target, but the oscillations will decay over time, eventually stabilizing
      at the target.
    - Overdamped: Damping greater than one will not have any oscillation, and the spring will take
      extra time to reach the target.
    - Critical Damping: When the damping is exactly 1.0, there is no oscillation and the spring
      takes the minimum amount of time to reach the target (based on the frequency).

    The default damping ratio is zero.
