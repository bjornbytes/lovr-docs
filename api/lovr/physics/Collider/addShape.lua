    By default, LÃ–VR will recompute mass properties for the Collider as shapes are added and
    removed.  Use `Collider:setAutomaticMass` to enable or disable this behavior.

    Shapes can only be attached to a single Collider.  Attempting to attach a shape to multiple
    colliders (or to a single collider multiple times) will error.  Use `Collider:removeShape` to
    remove shapes from their original collider before reattaching them.

    Adding a `MeshShape` or a `TerrainShape` will force the Collider to be immobile.  It will
    immediately become kinematic, and will not move via velocity or forces.  However, it can still
    be repositioned with methods like `Collider:setPosition`.
