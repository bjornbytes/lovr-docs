    Although setting the velocity directly is useful sometimes, it can cause problems:

    - Velocity ignores mass, so it can lead to unnaturally sharp changes in motion.
    - If the velocity of a Collider is changed multiple times during a frame, only the last one is
      going to have an effect, nullifying the other velocities that were set.
    - Setting the velocity of a Collider every frame can mess up collisions, since the forces used
      to resolve a collision will get ignored by changing the velocity.

    Using forces and impulses to move Colliders will avoid all of these issues.

    If the Collider is asleep, setting the velocity to a non-zero value will wake it up.

    If the Collider has a tag that was marked as static when the World was created, then the
    Collider can not move and this function will do nothing.
