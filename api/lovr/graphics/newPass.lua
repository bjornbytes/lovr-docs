    Fun facts about render passes:

    - Textures must have been created with the `render` `TextureUsage`.
    - Textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and sample counts.
    - When rendering to textures with multiple layers, each draw will be broadcast to all layers.
      Render passes have multiple "views" (cameras), and each layer uses a corresponding view,
      allowing each layer to be rendered from a different viewpoint.  This enables fast stereo
      rendering, but can also be used to efficiently render to cubemaps.  The `ViewIndex` variable
      can also be used in shaders to set up any desired per-view behavior.
    - Mipmaps will automatically be generated for textures at the end of the render pass.
    - It's okay to have zero color textures, but in this case there must be a depth texture.
    - It's possible to render to a specific mipmap level of a Texture, or a subset of its layers, by
      rendering to texture views, see `lovr.graphics.newTextureView`.
