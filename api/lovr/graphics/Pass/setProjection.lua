  notes = [[
    A far clipping plane of 0.0 can be used for an infinite far plane with reversed Z range.  This
    is the default because it improves depth precision and reduces Z fighting.  Using a non-infinite
    far plane requires the depth buffer to be cleared to 1.0 instead of 0.0 and the default depth
    test to be changed to `lequal` instead of `gequal`.

    By default, the projection is set by the headset.  Each HMD has a specific field of view given
    by `lovr.headset.getViewAngles`, and the clipping planes can be customized with
    `lovr.headset.setClipDistance`.
