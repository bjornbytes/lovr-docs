    The depth test is an advanced technique to control how 3D objects overlap each other when they
    are rendered.  It works as follows:

    - Each pixel keeps track of its z value as well as its color.
    - If `write` is enabled when something is drawn, then any pixels that are drawn will have their
      z values updated.
    - Additionally, anything drawn will first compare the existing z value of a pixel with the new z
      value.  The `compareMode` setting determines how this comparison is performed.  If the
      comparison succeeds, the new pixel will overwrite the previous one, otherwise that pixel won't
      be rendered to.

    Smaller z values are closer to the camera.

    The default compare mode is `lequal`, which usually gives good results for normal 3D rendering.
