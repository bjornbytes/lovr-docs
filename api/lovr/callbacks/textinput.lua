    Some characters in UTF-8 unicode take multiple bytes to encode.  Due to the way Lua works, the
    length of these strings will be bigger than 1 even though they are just a single character.  The
    `utf8` library included with LÃ–VR can be used to manipulate UTF-8 strings.  `Pass:text` will
    also correctly handle UTF-8.
