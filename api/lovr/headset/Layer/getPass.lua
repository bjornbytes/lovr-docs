    This function will reset the Layer's render pass when it is called, as though `Pass:reset` was
    called.

    The Pass will have its background color cleared to the background color, set using
    `lovr.graphics.setBackgroundColor`.

    The Pass will have its view matrix set to the origin, and its projection will be set to an
    orthographic matrix where the top left of the texture is at the origin and the bottom right of
    the texture will be at `(width, height)` in pixels.
