Instead, there are `Source` objects in `lovr.audio` that are used for audio playback.  All Source objects are backed by one of these Sounds, and multiple Sources can share a single Sound to reduce memory usage.\n\nMetadata\n---\n\nSounds hold a fixed number of frames.  Each frame contains one audio sample for each channel. The `SampleFormat` of the Sound is the data type used for each sample (floating point, integer, etc.).  The Sound has a `ChannelLayout`, representing the number of audio channels and how they map to speakers (mono, stereo, etc.).  The sample rate of the Sound indicates how many frames should be played per second.  The duration of the sound (in seconds) is the number of frames divided by the sample rate.\n\nCompression\n---\n\nSounds can be compressed.  Compressed sounds are stored compressed in memory and are decoded as they are played.  This uses a lot less memory but increases CPU usage during playback.  OGG and MP3 are compressed audio formats.  When creating a sound from a compressed format, there is an option to immediately decode it, storing it uncompressed in memory.  It can be a good idea to decode short sound effects, since they won't use very much memory even when uncompressed and it will improve CPU usage.  Compressed sounds can not be written to using `Sound:setFrames`.\n\nStreams\n---\n\nSounds can be created as a stream by passing `'stream'` as their contents when creating them. Audio frames can be written to the end of the stream, and read from the beginning.  This works well for situations where data is being generated in real time or streamed in from some other data source.\n\nSources can be backed by a stream and they'll just play whatever audio is pushed to the stream. The audio module also lets you use a stream as a \"sink\" for an audio device.  For playback devices, this works like loopback, so the mixed audio from all playing Sources will get written to the stream.  For capture devices, all the microphone input will get written to the stream. Conversion between sample formats, channel layouts, and sample rates will happen automatically.\n\nKeep in mind that streams can still only hold a fixed number of frames.  If too much data is written before it is read, older frames will start to get overwritten.  Similary, it's possible to read too much data without writing fast enough.\n\nAmbisonics\n---\n\nAmbisonic sounds can be imported from WAVs, but can not yet be played.  Sounds with a `ChannelLayout` of `ambisonic` are stored as first-order full-sphere ambisonics using the AmbiX format (ACN channel ordering and SN3D channel normalization).  The AMB format is supported for import and will automatically get converted to AmbiX.  See `lovr.data.newSound` for more info.",

The length of a Buffer and its format (the type of each value) are declared upfront and can't be changed.  Each value of a Buffer consists of one or more fields, and each field has a type.  For example, if a Buffer is used to store vertices, each value might store 3 fields for the position, normal vector, and UV coordinates of a vertex.\n\nBuffers are commonly used for:\n\n- Mesh data: Buffers hold the data that define the vertices in a mesh. Buffers also store the\n  vertex indices of a mesh, which define the order the vertices are connected together into\n  triangles. These are often called vertex buffers and index buffers.\n- Shader data: Buffers can be bound to a Shader, letting the Shader read arbitrary data. For\n  example, Lua code could create a Buffer with the positions and colors of all the lights in a\n  scene, which a Shader can use to do lighting calculations.\n- Compute: Compute shaders can write data to Buffers.  This GPU-generated data can be used in\n  later rendering work or sent back to Lua.\n- Indirect: Indirect rendering is an advanced technique where instructions for rendering work\n  are recorded to a Buffer (potentially by a compute shader) and later drawn.\n\nThere are two types of Buffers:\n\n- **Temporary** buffers are very inexpensive to create, and writing to them from Lua is fast.\n  However, they become invalid at the end of `lovr.draw` (i.e. when `lovr.graphics.submit` is\n  called).  The GPU is slightly slower at accessing data from temporary buffers, and compute\n  shaders can not write to them.  They are designed for storing data that changes every frame.\n- **Permanent** buffers are more expensive to create, and updating their contents requires a\n  transfer from CPU memory to VRAM.  They act like normal LÖVR objects and don't need to be\n  recreated every frame.  They often have faster performance when used by the GPU, and compute\n  shaders can write to them.

It's declared in the shader code, like this:\n\n    layout(local_size_x = w, local_size_y = h, local_size_z = d) in;\n\nAll these 3D grids can get confusing, but the basic idea is to make the local workgroup size a small block of e.g. 32 particles or 8x8 pixels or 4x4x4 voxels, and then dispatch however many workgroups are needed to cover a list of particles, image, voxel field, etc.\n\nThe reason to do it this way is that the GPU runs its threads in little fixed-size bundles called subgroups.  Subgroups are usually 32 or 64 threads (the exact size is given by the `subgroupSize` property of `lovr.graphics.getDevice`) and all run together.  If the local workgroup size was `1x1x1`, then the GPU would only run 1 thread per subgroup and waste the other 31 or 63.  So for the best performance, be sure to set a local workgroup size bigger than 1!\n\nInside the compute shader, a few builtin variables can be used to figure out which workgroup is running:\n\n- `uvec3 WorkgroupCount` is the workgroup count per axis (the `Pass:compute` arguments).\n- `uvec3 WorkgroupSize` is the local workgroup size (declared in the shader).\n- `uvec3 WorkgroupID` is the index of the current (global) workgroup.\n- `uvec3 LocalThreadID` is the index of the local workgroup inside its workgroup.\n- `uint LocalThreadIndex` is a 1D version of `LocalThreadID`.\n- `uvec3 GlobalThreadID` is the unique identifier for a thread within all workgroups in a\n  dispatch. It's equivalent to `WorkgroupID * WorkgroupSize + LocalThreadID` (usually what you\n  want!)\n\nIndirect compute dispatches are useful to \"chain\" compute shaders together, while keeping all of the data on the GPU.  The first dispatch can do some computation and write some results to buffers, then the second indirect dispatch can use the data in those buffers to know how many times it should run.  An example would be a compute shader that does some sort of object culling, writing the number of visible objects to a buffer along with the IDs of each one. Subsequent compute shaders can be indirectly dispatched to perform extra processing on the visible objects.  Finally, an indirect draw can be used to render them.",

This enables fast stereo\n  rendering, but can also be used to efficiently render to cubemaps.  The `ViewIndex` variable\n  can also be used in shaders to set up any desired per-view behavior.\n- If `mipmap` is true, then any textures with mipmaps must have the `transfer` `TextureUsage`.\n- It's okay to have zero color textures, but in this case there must be a depth texture.\n- Setting `clear` to `false` for textures is usually very slow on mobile GPUs.\n- It's possible to render to a specific mipmap level of a Texture, or a subset of its layers, by\n  rendering to texture views, see `Texture:newView`.\n\nFor `compute` and `transfer` passes, all of the commands in the pass act as though they run in parallel.  This means that writing to the same element of a buffer twice, or writing to it and reading from it again is not guaranteed to work properly on all GPUs.  LÖVR is not currently able to check for this.  If compute or transfers need to be sequenced, multiple passes should be used.  It is, however, completely fine to read and write to non-overlapping regions of the same buffer or texture.",

They are individual objects that are garbage collected when no longer needed.  They're created using the usual `lovr.math.new<Type>` syntax:\n\n    self.position = lovr.math.newVec3(x, y, z)\n\n**Temporary** vectors are created from a shared pool of vector objects.  This makes them faster because they use temporary memory and do not need to be garbage collected.  To make a temporary vector, leave off the `new` prefix:\n\n    local position = lovr.math.vec3(x, y, z)\n\nAs a further shorthand, these vector constructors are placed on the global scope.  If you prefer to keep the global scope clean, this can be configured using the `t.math.globals` flag in `lovr.conf`.\n\n    local position = vec3(x1, y1, z1) + vec3(x2, y2, z2)\n\nTemporary vectors, with all their speed, come with an important restriction: they can only be used during the frame in which they were created.  Saving them into variables and using them later on will throw an error:\n\n    local position = vec3(1, 2, 3)\n\n    function lovr.update(dt)\n      -- Reusing a temporary vector across frames will error:\n      position:add(vec3(dt))\n    end\n\nIt's possible to overflow the temporary vector pool.  If that happens, `lovr.math.drain` can be used to periodically drain the pool, invalidating any existing temporary vectors.\n\n### Metamethods\n\nVectors have metamethods, allowing them to be used using the normal math operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.\n\n    print(vec3(2, 4, 6) * .5 + vec3(10, 20, 30))\n\nThese metamethods will create new temporary vectors.\n\n### Components and Swizzles\n\nThe raw components of a vector can be accessed like normal fields:\n\n    print(vec3(1, 2, 3).z) --> 3\n    print(mat4()[16]) --> 1\n\nAlso, multiple fields can be accessed and combined into a new (temporary) vector, called swizzling:\n\n    local position = vec3(10, 5, 1)\n    print(position.xy) --> vec2(10, 5)\n    print(position.xyy) --> vec3(10, 5, 5)\n    print(position.zyxz) --> vec4(1, 5, 10, 1)\n\nThe following fields are supported for vectors:\n\n- `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`\n- `r`, `g`, `b`, `a`\n- `s`, `t`, `p`, `q`\n\nQuaternions support `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.\n\nMatrices use numbers for accessing individual components in \"column-major\" order.\n\nAll fields can also be assigned to.\n\n    -- Swap the components of a 2D vector\n    v.xy = v.yx\n\nThe `unpack` function can be used (on any vector type) to access all of the individual components of a vector object.  For quaternions you can choose whether you want to unpack the angle/axis representation or the raw quaternion components.  Similarly, matrices support raw unpacking as well as decomposition into translation/scale/rotation values.",
