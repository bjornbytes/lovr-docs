Instead, there are `Source` objects in `lovr.audio` that are used for audio playback.  All Source objects are backed by one of these Sounds, and multiple Sources can share a single Sound to reduce memory usage.\n\nMetadata\n---\n\nSounds hold a fixed number of frames.  Each frame contains one audio sample for each channel. The `SampleFormat` of the Sound is the data type used for each sample (floating point, integer, etc.).  The Sound has a `ChannelLayout`, representing the number of audio channels and how they map to speakers (mono, stereo, etc.).  The sample rate of the Sound indicates how many frames should be played per second.  The duration of the sound (in seconds) is the number of frames divided by the sample rate.\n\nCompression\n---\n\nSounds can be compressed.  Compressed sounds are stored compressed in memory and are decoded as they are played.  This uses a lot less memory but increases CPU usage during playback.  OGG and MP3 are compressed audio formats.  When creating a sound from a compressed format, there is an option to immediately decode it, storing it uncompressed in memory.  It can be a good idea to decode short sound effects, since they won't use very much memory even when uncompressed and it will improve CPU usage.  Compressed sounds can not be written to using `Sound:setFrames`.\n\nStreams\n---\n\nSounds can be created as a stream by passing `'stream'` as their contents when creating them. Audio frames can be written to the end of the stream, and read from the beginning.  This works well for situations where data is being generated in real time or streamed in from some other data source.\n\nSources can be backed by a stream and they'll just play whatever audio is pushed to the stream. The audio module also lets you use a stream as a \"sink\" for an audio device.  For playback devices, this works like loopback, so the mixed audio from all playing Sources will get written to the stream.  For capture devices, all the microphone input will get written to the stream. Conversion between sample formats, channel layouts, and sample rates will happen automatically.\n\nKeep in mind that streams can still only hold a fixed number of frames.  If too much data is written before it is read, older frames will start to get overwritten.  Similary, it's possible to read too much data without writing fast enough.\n\nAmbisonics\n---\n\nAmbisonic sounds can be imported from WAVs, but can not yet be played.  Sounds with a `ChannelLayout` of `ambisonic` are stored as first-order full-sphere ambisonics using the AmbiX format (ACN channel ordering and SN3D channel normalization).  The AMB format is supported for import and will automatically get converted to AmbiX.  See `lovr.data.newSound` for more info.",

The length of a Buffer and its format (the type of each value) are declared upfront and can't be changed.  Each value of a Buffer consists of one or more fields, and each field has a type.  For example, if a Buffer is used to store vertices, each value might store 3 fields for the position, normal vector, and UV coordinates of a vertex.\n\nBuffers are commonly used for:\n\n- Mesh data: Buffers hold the data that define the vertices in a mesh. Buffers also store the\n  vertex indices of a mesh, which define the order the vertices are connected together into\n  triangles. These are often called vertex buffers and index buffers.\n- Shader data: Buffers can be bound to a Shader, letting the Shader read arbitrary data. For\n  example, Lua code could create a Buffer with the positions and colors of all the lights in a\n  scene, which a Shader can use to do lighting calculations.\n- Compute: Compute shaders can write data to Buffers.  This GPU-generated data can be used in\n  later rendering work or sent back to Lua.\n- Indirect: Indirect rendering is an advanced technique where instructions for rendering work\n  are recorded to a Buffer (potentially by a compute shader) and later drawn.\n\nThere are two types of Buffers:\n\n- **Temporary** buffers are very inexpensive to create, and writing to them from Lua is fast.\n  However, they become invalid at the end of `lovr.draw` (i.e. when `lovr.graphics.submit` is\n  called).  The GPU is slightly slower at accessing data from temporary buffers, and compute\n  shaders can not write to them.  They are designed for storing data that changes every frame.\n- **Permanent** buffers are more expensive to create, and updating their contents requires a\n  transfer from CPU memory to VRAM.  They act like normal LÖVR objects and don't need to be\n  recreated every frame.  They often have faster performance when used by the GPU, and compute\n  shaders can write to them.  They are great for large pieces of data that are initialized once\n  at load time, or data that is updated infrequently.",

Mipmaps help make the Texture look smoother at smaller sizes, and also improve the performance of reading data from the Texture in a Shader.\n\nWhen used as a render target, the Texture can store multiple different color samples for each pixel, which can be averaged together after rendering to do antialiasing (this is called multisample antialiasing, or MSAA).\n\nIt is possible to create multiple views of a single Texture.

They are individual objects that are garbage collected when no longer needed.  They're created using the usual `lovr.math.new<Type>` syntax:\n\n    self.position = lovr.math.newVec3(x, y, z)\n\n**Temporary** vectors are created from a shared pool of vector objects.  This makes them faster because they use temporary memory and do not need to be garbage collected.  To make a temporary vector, leave off the `new` prefix:\n\n    local position = lovr.math.vec3(x, y, z)\n\nAs a further shorthand, these vector constructors are placed on the global scope.  If you prefer to keep the global scope clean, this can be configured using the `t.math.globals` flag in `lovr.conf`.\n\n    local position = vec3(x1, y1, z1) + vec3(x2, y2, z2)\n\nTemporary vectors, with all their speed, come with an important restriction: they can only be used during the frame in which they were created.  Saving them into variables and using them later on will throw an error:\n\n    local position = vec3(1, 2, 3)\n\n    function lovr.update(dt)\n      -- Reusing a temporary vector across frames will error:\n      position:add(vec3(dt))\n    end\n\nIt's possible to overflow the temporary vector pool.  If that happens, `lovr.math.drain` can be used to periodically drain the pool, invalidating any existing temporary vectors.\n\n### Metamethods\n\nVectors have metamethods, allowing them to be used using the normal math operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.\n\n    print(vec3(2, 4, 6) * .5 + vec3(10, 20, 30))\n\nThese metamethods will create new temporary vectors.\n\n### Components and Swizzles\n\nThe raw components of a vector can be accessed like normal fields:\n\n    print(vec3(1, 2, 3).z) --> 3\n    print(mat4()[16]) --> 1\n\nAlso, multiple fields can be accessed and combined into a new (temporary) vector, called swizzling:\n\n    local position = vec3(10, 5, 1)\n    print(position.xy) --> vec2(10, 5)\n    print(position.xyy) --> vec3(10, 5, 5)\n    print(position.zyxz) --> vec4(1, 5, 10, 1)\n\nThe following fields are supported for vectors:\n\n- `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`\n- `r`, `g`, `b`, `a`\n- `s`, `t`, `p`, `q`\n\nQuaternions support `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.\n\nMatrices use numbers for accessing individual components in \"column-major\" order.\n\nAll fields can also be assigned to.\n\n    -- Swap the components of a 2D vector\n    v.xy = v.yx\n\nThe `unpack` function can be used (on any vector type) to access all of the individual components of a vector object.  For quaternions you can choose whether you want to unpack the angle/axis representation or the raw quaternion components.  Similarly, matrices support raw unpacking as well as decomposition into translation/scale/rotation values.",
